## Decision Rationale

### Why Next.js 15 + App Router?
Next.js represents the gold standard for React applications in production. The App Router provides:
- **Server Components** for optimal performance and SEO
- **Streaming SSR** for improved user experience
- **Built-in optimizations** that would take months to implement manually
- **Developer experience** that keeps our team shipping faster

We evaluated alternatives like Remix and SvelteKit but chose Next.js for its ecosystem maturity and Vercel's infrastructure optimizations.

### Why Supabase?
Supabase gives us enterprise-grade PostgreSQL without the operational overhead:
- **Instant database** with built-in auth, real-time subscriptions, and edge functions
- **Row Level Security** for data protection without complex middleware
- **Auto-scaling** handles our traffic spikes without intervention
- **Developer experience** that matches modern React patterns

We considered Firebase and PlanetScale but chose Supabase for its PostgreSQL compatibility and superior developer tooling.

### Why Tailwind CSS v4?
Tailwind v4 represents the future of utility-first CSS:
- **Native CSS** engine eliminates JavaScript build overhead
- **Lightning fast** compilation with zero runtime CSS
- **Advanced features** like CSS variables, container queries, and logical properties
- **Modern toolchain** integration with PostCSS and build tools

The performance gains and developer experience improvements made this an easy choice over v3 or alternatives like styled-components.

### Why TypeScript?
Type safety isn't optional in production applications:
- **Catches errors** before they reach users
- **Improves refactoring** speed and safety
- **Enhances IDE experience** with autocomplete and documentation
- **Team collaboration** through explicit contracts

We never considered JavaScript for this project—TypeScript is the industry standard for scalable applications.

## Quick Start (Production Setup)

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** - Latest LTS for optimal performance
- **npm/yarn/pnpm** - Package manager of your choice
- **Supabase Account** - For database and authentication
- **Resend Account** - For transactional email delivery

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the production repository
git clone https://github.com/e-ogugua/emmdraEmpireAndLifestyle.git
cd emmdraEmpireAndLifestyle

# Install dependencies (we use npm for consistency)
npm ci

# Environment setup
cp .env.example .env.local
```

**Configure .env.local:**
```env
# Production Database (Supabase)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Email Service (Resend - recommended)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your-resend-api-key

# Admin Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@emmdraempire.com,manager@emmdraempire.com

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production
```

```bash
# Start development server (with Turbopack for speed)
npm run dev

# Verify installation
open http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Production Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # Development with Turbopack (fastest)
npm run build     # Production build with Turbopack
npm run start     # Production server
npm run lint      # Code quality checks
```

### State Management Strategy
- **React Context** for global state (cart, user preferences)
- **Server State** via React Query for API data
- **URL State** for navigation and filters
- **Local Storage** for user preferences and cart persistence

### Database Design
- **Products** - Inventory management with variants and pricing
- **Orders** - Complete order lifecycle with status tracking
- **Users** - Customer profiles and preferences
- **Content** - Blog posts, workshops, and DIY tutorials
- **Analytics** - Event tracking and performance metrics

---

## Security & Production Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth** for user management
- **Row Level Security** for data access control
- **Admin role management** with email-based permissions
- **Session management** with secure cookie handling

### Data Protection
- **Input validation** with Zod schemas
- **SQL injection protection** via Supabase
- **XSS prevention** through React's escaping
- **CSRF protection** with Next.js middleware

### Performance Optimization
- **Image optimization** with Next.js Image component
- **Code splitting** for optimal bundle sizes
- **Edge caching** via Vercel's global CDN
- **Database indexing** for query performance

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Recommended: Vercel (Zero-config)
```bash
# Connect repository to Vercel
# Environment variables auto-detected
# Deploy with optimizations enabled

# Benefits:
# - Zero configuration deployment
# - Global edge network
# - Automatic HTTPS
# - Performance optimizations
```

### Alternative: Manual Deployment
```bash
npm run build
npm run start

# Production checklist:
# Environment variables configured
# Database migrations run
# Email service tested
# Domain DNS configured
# SSL certificate installed
```
